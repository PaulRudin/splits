This project contains quick and dirty code for inducing specified
splits from a .tcx file (produced by various garmin gps watches).

The file splits.py can be used standalone - it depends on numpy and
scipy, and on the included garmin.py, which was generated from
garmin's xml schema by generateDS.

splits.wsgi contains a simple web app for running the same
functionality.
